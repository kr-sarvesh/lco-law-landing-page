## About

This project is created using HTML and CSS. I have used CSS Positioning and CSS flex-box to build this project, and this project is not fully responsive.
In future I will try to make it fully responive.

## What did I learn by making this project?

-   learn CSS positioning in detail.
-   learn to use CSS variables.
-   learn to use flex-box.

## Time taken to finish this project?

Although this project looks simple and easy but when I started working on it, it took me around 5 to 6hour to finish it.
